- If you make changes to a PR, be sure to re-request a review.
- Don't repeadetely tag someone(may be it is not the right time to review your PR), be patient.
- Do not 'resolve conversation' unnecessary raised by a community member or any workflow tools(codeclimate or hound) as they may have some purpose, try to resolve the request changes and if any help wanted tag a community member to give views about that.
