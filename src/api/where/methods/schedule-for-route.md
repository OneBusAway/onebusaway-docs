## Request Parameters

* id - the route id to request the schedule for, encoded directly in the URL:
	* `http://api.pugetsound.onebusaway.org/api/where/schedule-for-route/[ID_GOES_HERE].xml`
* date - The date for which you want to request a schedule of the format YYYY-MM-DD (optional, defaults to current date)
    * `http://api.pugetsound.onebusaway.org/api/where/schedule-for-route/[ID_GOES_HERE].json?key=[KEY]&date=[DATE-GOES-HERE]`


## Response


The intent of this response is to mimic a traditional schedule-table format for viewing a route. As such the entry includes traditional header information, as well as a section of concentrated schedule information (in the form of stopTripGroupings).

The header information is:
* `<routeId/>` - the route being looked into -  this information is presented in the format `[agency]_[routeIdentifier]`
* `<scheduleDate/>` - the date being looked at  -  the date of service in milliseconds since the Unix epoch
* `<serviceIds>` - the Service Ids which contain that route and are live on the specified date -  for more information see the [GTFS spec](http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html)

The entry also has concentrated schedule information in the form of stopTripGroupings. Each grouping includes:
* `<directionId\>` - the direction the trips are heading -  for more information see the [GTFS spec](http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html)
* `<tripHeadsign\>` - the trip headsign - a string indicting the destination of the trip
* `<stopIds\>` - an ordered list of stop Ids - Each id is of the format `[agency]_[stopIdentifier]`
* `<tripIds\>` - a list of trip Ids that matched by shared direction- Each trip Id is of the format `[agency]_[tripIdentifier]`


Alternate codes:
404 - returned if the route ID in the request is not found
510 - returned if the route has no schedules for the day requested
