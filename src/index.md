## Functionality

The OneBusAway application suite's primary function is to share real-time public transit information with riders across
a variety of interfaces:

* [OneBusAway Web](/features/web) - A variety of web interfaces to transit data
    * A standard web interface to transit data, including maps and stop pages with real-time info
    * A mobile-optimized version of the web interface for mobile browsers
    * A text-only version of the web interface for more-basic mobile browsers
* [OneBusAway REST API](/api/where) - A RESTful web-service that can be used to quickly write applications
built on top of transit data.  This API powers:
    * The OneBusAway [iOS application](https://github.com/onebusaway/onebusaway-ios)
    * The OneBusAway [Android application](https://github.com/onebusaway/onebusaway-android)
* [OneBusAway Phone](/features/phone-and-sms) - A Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone application for accessing real-time transit information
* [OneBusAway SMS](/features/phone-and-sms) - An SMS service for accessing real-time transit information
* [OneBusAway Sign Mode](/features/sign-mode) - A interface mode optimized for large public displays

These interfaces are powered by a transit-data back-end module that combines raw transit data (GTFS, GTFS-realtime, etc)
into an optimized data-bundle appropriate for application development.
